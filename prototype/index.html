    <h2>What are tree frogs?</h2>
<p><strong>Tree frogs are small, agile amphibians</strong> known for their remarkable ability to climb and thrive in trees.
    With their distinctive adhesive toe pads, they can easily navigate vertical surfaces, making them well-suited to their arboreal habitats.
    <em>Tree frogs are found in various regions worldwide</em>, particularly in tropical and subtropical climates.
    Their vibrant colors, which range from greens and browns to more vivid hues, help them blend into their surroundings or warn predators of potential danger.
    These amphibians play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem balance by controlling insect populations and serving as both predator and prey in their environments.</p>

<p>There are several popular species of tree frogs, each known for its unique characteristics and vibrant appearances. <em>The Red-Eyed Tree Frog</em> (Agalychnis callidryas) is perhaps the most iconic, with its bright green body,
    striking red eyes, and blue-and-yellow striped sides. Another well-known species is the <em>Green Tree Frog</em> (Hyla cinerea), commonly found in the southeastern United States, characterized by its smooth, lime-green skin.
    The Gray Tree Frog (Hyla versicolor), native to North America, is admired for its ability to change colors to blend in with its surroundings.
    Additionally, the <em>Amazon Milk Frog</em> (Trachycephalus resinifictrix) stands out with its distinctive milky white skin and dark brown markings.
    These species highlight the diversity and adaptability of tree frogs across various habitats.</p>
