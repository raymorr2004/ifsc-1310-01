    <h2>What are tree frogs?</h2>
<p><strong>Tree frogs are small, agile</strong> amphibians known for their remarkable ability to climb and thrive in trees. With their distinctive adhesive toe pads, they can easily navigate vertical surfaces,
    making them well-suited to their arboreal habitats. <em>Tree frogs are found in various regions worldwide</em>, particularly in tropical and subtropical climates.
    Their vibrant colors, which range from greens and browns to more vivid hues, help them blend into their surroundings or warn predators of potential danger.
    As one quote puts it, <q>The tree frog, with its simple life of stillness and leaping, reminds us to find balance between action and rest.</q>
    These amphibians play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem balance by controlling insect populations and serving as both predator and prey in their environments.</p>

<p>There are several popular species of tree frogs, each known for its unique characteristics and vibrant appearances. <em>The Red-Eyed Tree Frog</em> (Agalychnis callidryas) is perhaps the most iconic, with its bright green body,
    striking red eyes, and blue-and-yellow striped sides. Another well-known species is the <em>Green Tree Frog</em> (Hyla cinerea), commonly found in the southeastern United States, characterized by its smooth, lime-green skin.
    The Gray Tree Frog (Hyla versicolor), native to North America, is admired for its ability to change colors to blend in with its surroundings.
    Additionally, the <em>Amazon Milk Frog</em> (Trachycephalus resinifictrix) stands out with its distinctive milky white skin and dark brown markings.
    These species highlight the diversity and adaptability of tree frogs across various habitats.</p>

<h2>The Red Eyed Tree Frog</h2>
    <img src="/workspaces/ifsc-1310-01/prototype/assets/img/redeyetreefrog.jpg" alt="Red Eyed Tree Frog">
<p><strong>The Red-Eyed Tree Frog</strong> (Agalychnis callidryas) is a visually striking amphibian known for its vibrant appearance and large, crimson-colored eyes.
    Native to the rainforests of Central America, this frog features a <em>bright green body</em> with blue and yellow sides, making it highly recognizable.
    Its <em>vivid red eyes</em> are believed to help startle predators, giving the frog a chance to escape. Despite its bold colors,
    the Red-Eyed Tree Frog is nocturnal and blends in with its surroundings by tucking its legs and closing its eyes during the day, camouflaging itself against the foliage.
    These tree frogs primarily live in humid environments and spend most of their time clinging to leaves and branches in the dense rainforest canopy. There are many other tree frogs that camoflauge.</p>

    <h3>Some Other Camoflauging Tree Frogs:</h3>
    <ol>
<li>Gray Tree Frog (Hyla versicolor)</li>
<li>White's Tree Frog (Litoria caerulea)</li>
<li>Mossy Frog (Theloderma corticale)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Tree frogs can change to many different colors, depending on the type of frog and the habitat it lives in.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Green (such as the Red-Eyed Tree Frog)</li>
        <li>Brown (such as the Gray Tree Frog)</li>
        <li>Gray (Another color the Gray Tree Frog uses)</li>
        <li>Yellow (Common for poisonous tree frogs)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Poisonous frogs are not to be messed with. It is important to be knowledgeable about these creatures. While the most dangerous are not classified as tree frogs, they share many similarities in size, environment, and habits.</p>
    <blockquote>
        "The poison dart frog carries enough toxin to kill ten grown men, yet it sits calmly, a vivid paradox of beauty and danger." <cite>Unknown</cite>
        </blockquote>
<dl>
    <dt>Golden Poison Dart Frog</dt>
    <dd>Considered one of the most toxic animals on Earth, this small, brightly colored frog from the rainforests of Colombia secretes a powerful toxin called batrachotoxin,
        which can be deadly to predators and humans.
        Although not technically a tree frog, it is often found in similar environments and shares many of the same characterists.</dd>
<dt>Black-legged Poison Dart Frog</dt>
    <dd>Native to Central and South America, this frog produces potent toxins that can cause serious harm or death to predators.
        Like the Golden Poison Dart Frog, it secretes batrachotoxin, though in smaller amounts.</dd>
<dt>Blue Poison Dart Frog</dt>
    <dd>Found in the rainforests of Suriname and Brazil, this frog has vivid blue skin and secretes toxins through its skin that can cause paralysis or death in predators.</dd>
