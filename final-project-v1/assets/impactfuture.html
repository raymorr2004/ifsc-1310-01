<h1>How Our Actions Impact the Future</h1>

    <h3>Rainforest Size Has Reduced</h3>
    <p>In the past 50 years, about half of the world’s tropical rainforests—around 1.2
        million square miles—have been destroyed. This massive loss threatens biodiversity and
        accelerates climate change by reducing natural carbon storage.</p>

<p>Declining tree frog populations could have serious future impacts on ecosystems.
    Tree frogs help control insect populations, and without them, pest species could grow unchecked,
    harming plants and crops. They also serve as prey for various animals, so their decline would disrupt
    food chains and threaten other species’ survival. Additionally, tree frogs are indicators of
    environmental health; their decline signals worsening habitat conditions, like pollution and climate
    change, that can affect countless other species. Protecting tree frogs is essential to maintaining
    balanced, resilient ecosystems.</p>
<h2>Future Impacts of Rainforest Destruction</h2>
<p>The reduction of rainforests poses a grave danger to countless animal species that depend on these
    dense, diverse ecosystems for survival. As rainforests shrink, species lose their habitats, food
    sources, and breeding grounds, pushing many toward extinction. This loss reduces biodiversity,
    weakening the ecological balance that supports resilient ecosystems. Animals like jaguars,
    orangutans, and many unique birds and insects face immediate risks, and as species disappear, the
    entire food web becomes unstable, affecting both prominent and lesser-known organisms that are vital to a healthy ecosystem.</p>

        <h3>Red Eyed Tree Frog Population Decline</h3>
    <p>Red-eyed tree frog populations have dropped by nearly 30% in recent decades due to habitat loss,
        pollution, and disease. Rainforest destruction for agriculture and development reduces their breeding
        areas, while pesticide pollution and the spread of diseases like chytridiomycosis threaten their
        survival. Without urgent conservation efforts, these declines may continue, putting the species at serious risk.</p>
    </div>
    </article>

<p>For humans, the loss of rainforests brings serious consequences as well.
    Rainforests play a crucial role in regulating global climate by absorbing carbon dioxide, so their
    reduction accelerates climate change, leading to extreme weather patterns and rising temperatures.
    Additionally, many of the world’s medicines are derived from rainforest plants, and reducing these
    forests limits potential discoveries of life-saving drugs. The loss of rainforests also impacts
    indigenous communities who rely on them for shelter, food, and cultural practices.
    Protecting rainforests is essential, not only for preserving wildlife but also for ensuring
    a stable, sustainable future for humanity.</p>
<h2>Actions Taken Now Can Save The Future</h2>
<p>
    Immediate actions are essential to prevent further rainforest destruction and its devastating
    impacts. Governments must enforce stricter regulations against illegal logging and unsustainable
    land clearing, while promoting reforestation efforts to restore lost habitats. Supporting sustainable
    agriculture practices can help reduce the need for new farmland in rainforest areas. Additionally,
    consumers can make a difference by choosing eco-friendly products that do not contribute to
    deforestation, such as sustainably sourced wood and certified palm oil. Conservation organizations
    need funding to expand protected areas and research alternative ways to support local economies
    without harming rainforests. By acting now, we can help preserve these
    critical ecosystems and protect biodiversity, climate stability, and natural resources for the future.</p>
