    <h3>Dangers to the Environment</h3>
    <p>
        Human activities severely threaten tree frogs by destroying forests, polluting water,
        and altering climates essential for their survival. Deforestation and urban growth eliminate
        their habitats, while pollution and climate shifts disrupt their breeding cycles. Invasive species
        introduced by humans also add predators and diseases, pushing tree frogs closer to endangerment.</p>

<p>Red-eyed tree frogs play a crucial role in maintaining the health and balance of their ecosystems.
    As both predators and prey, these vibrant amphibians help control insect populations,
    which supports plant growth and reduces the spread of insect-borne diseases.
    By providing a food source for a variety of larger animals, including birds, snakes, 
    and mammals, red-eyed tree frogs contribute to the food web, sustaining biodiversity.
    Additionally, their presence in rainforests acts as an indicator of environmental health,
    as they are highly sensitive to changes in their habitat, such as pollution and climate shifts.
    Protecting these frogs is essential not only for preserving the beauty of the rainforest
    but also for maintaining its ecological stability.</p>
<h2>Common Predators and Prey</h2>
<p>Red-eyed tree frogs may be tiny, but they are constantly under threat from a host of formidable
    predators in the wild. Snakes, especially agile tree-climbers, silently stalk these colorful frogs
    as they sleep in the safety of leaves, ready to strike at any moment. Predatory birds,
    like toucans and herons, swoop down from above, searching the forest canopy for a quick meal,
    while mammals like opossums and even certain bats seize any chance to prey on these vulnerable frogs.
    Each predator relies on red-eyed tree frogs as a crucial part of their diet,
    creating a delicate balance in the rainforest ecosystem. When we protect these frogs,
    we’re not just helping a single species; we’re safeguarding an entire web of life that depends
    on their survival.</p>

        <h3>Red Eyed Tree Frog Habitats In Danger</h3>
    <p>Red-eyed tree frogs' habitats are at risk due to deforestation and human expansion in Central and
        South American rainforests. They need dense, humid forests to survive, but logging, agriculture,
        and climate change are rapidly destroying these essential environments, putting the species in danger.</p>
    </div>
    </article>

<p>Red-eyed tree frogs play an equally important role as tiny hunters in their own right,
    feeding on insects that would otherwise swarm the rainforest. With lightning-fast reflexes and
    sticky tongues, they capture crickets, flies, moths, and other small insects, preventing pest
    populations from overwhelming the delicate ecosystem. By keeping insect numbers in check,
    these frogs protect rainforest plants from harmful pests, allowing the forest to thrive.
    Their hunting efforts may seem small, but they ripple through the ecosystem, supporting plant life,
    preserving biodiversity, and even benefiting larger animals that rely on the forest’s resources.
    Helping red-eyed tree frogs means supporting the natural pest control they provide, ultimately
    preserving the balance of the rainforest. Protecting these little green warriors is a simple
    but powerful way to ensure the health and resilience of one of Earth’s most precious ecosystems.</p>
<h2>The Role These Frogs Play</h2>
<p>Red-eyed tree frogs play a vital role in their ecosystem by helping control insect populations,
    as they primarily feed on flies, moths, and other small insects. This natural pest control supports
    plant health and helps maintain balance in the rainforest. As prey, they also support a variety of
    larger species, including birds, snakes, and mammals, creating essential links within the food chain.
    Their presence indicates a healthy, biodiverse environment, and changes in their populations can
    signal shifts in habitat quality. Protecting red-eyed tree frogs thus helps preserve the broader ecosystem they are part of.</p>
