    <h3>Impacts of Humans on Tree Frogs</h3>
<p>Human interactions with red-eyed tree frogs are largely negative,
    as deforestation destroys their habitat, pollution contaminates their water sources,
    and climate change disrupts the rainforest ecosystem they depend on.</p>
</div>
</article>

<p>Human activities have a substantial negative impact on the environments that red-eyed tree frogs
    rely on. Deforestation for agriculture, logging, and urban expansion destroys the dense rainforests
    essential to their survival, removing the trees and foliage they use for shelter and breeding.
    Pollution from pesticides and industrial runoff contaminates the waterways they depend on, while
    climate change alters temperature and rainfall patterns, disrupting the humid conditions they need.
    Additionally, human introduction of invasive species brings new predators and diseases.
    Collectively, these actions endanger red-eyed tree frogs and degrade the ecosystems they support.</p>
<h2>Negative Impacts of Fewer Frogs</h2>
<p>A smaller population of red-eyed tree frogs can disrupt the balance of their habitat in several ways.
    As natural insect predators, fewer frogs mean insect populations could grow unchecked, potentially
    harming local plants and trees that rely on pollinators and are vulnerable to pest damage.
    The loss of red-eyed tree frogs also affects the food web, impacting predators like birds and snakes
    that rely on them for food. These shifts can trigger further imbalances, gradually weakening the
    rainforest ecosystemâ€™s stability and biodiversity. Protecting red-eyed tree frogs is essential for
    maintaining the health and balance of their environment.</p>

        <h3>Natural Impacts on Tree Frogs</h3>
        <p>Natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, and droughts can severely harm red-eyed tree frogs
            by destroying their rainforest habitat. Floods may wash away eggs, and droughts dry up
            essential water sources, disrupting their breeding. These disasters also reduce food sources
            and expose frogs to more predators, threatening their survival and the balance of their
            ecosystem.</p>
    </div>
    </article>


<h2>Negative Impacts of Captivity on Frogs</h2>
<p>Captivity can have serious negative effects on red-eyed tree frogs, as they are removed from their
    natural, complex habitats and placed in controlled, often limited environments. In captivity, they
    may experience stress due to confinement and lack of stimulation, which weakens their immune systems
    and makes them more susceptible to disease. Captive conditions can also disrupt their natural
    behaviors, such as hunting, breeding, and social interactions, which are essential for their
    well-being. Additionally, they often lack exposure to their natural diet, which can lead to
    nutritional deficiencies. Keeping red-eyed tree frogs in captivity not only compromises their health
    but also threatens the survival of wild populations if they are taken from the rainforest for trade.</p>
