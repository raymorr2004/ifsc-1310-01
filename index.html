    <p>Web accessibility means designing websites in a way that makes sure that all people, including those with disabilities, can navigate and interact with the web effectively.
    Examples of this include screen readers, keyboard navigation, and color contrast for people who are visually, physically, or otherwise impaired.
    Accessibility is not just about accommodating a minority; it ensures equal access and usability for everyone, creating an inclusive web environment.</p>

  <p>Building accessible websites is important because the internet has become an essential resource in everyday life.
    Making sure that no one is excluded from accessing information or services online gives individuals equal opportunities to use these resources.
    Additionally, accessibility improvements often lead to better overall user experience, including for users without disabilities, by fostering good design principles like ease of navigation and readability.</p>
