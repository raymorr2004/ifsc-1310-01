    <div>
  <p>Web accessibility means designing websites in a way that makes sure that all people, including those with disabilities, can navigate and interact with the web effectively.
    Examples of this include screen readers, keyboard navigation, and color contrast for people who are visually, physically, or otherwise impaired.
    Accessibility is not just about accommodating a minority; it ensures equal access and usability for everyone, creating an inclusive web environment.</p>

  <p>Building accessible websites is important because the internet has become an essential resource in everyday life.
    Making sure that no one is excluded from accessing information or services online gives individuals equal opportunities to use these resources.
    Additionally, accessibility improvements often lead to better overall user experience, including for users without disabilities, by fostering good design principles like ease of navigation and readability.</p>

<div id="divcontainer">
<div id="div1">
<p>Working on the final project website has been quite an experience. Throughout the project,
  I had the opportunity to implement the web functionality I learned while balancing the aesthetic and functional needs of diverse audiences.
  One thing I feel I did well was creating a visually appealing and responsive layout that worked seamlessly on different devices.
  I also successfully incorporated interactive elements, like hover effects, that enhanced the user experience without compromising accessibility or performance.</p>

<p>If I were to start this project over, I would focus more on the planning phase, especially when gathering feedback from users. Early in the project,
  I encountered conflicting suggestions from my sister and father about the website's design. My sister liked the images and interactive elements,
  while my dad preferred a clean, minimalist layout. At first, I found it challenging to work with these differences, but eventually decided to use a
  combination of both approaches. For instance, I added interactive elements with images to a clean design and ensured easy navigation for all users.
  In hindsight,
  conducting more targeted user research and creating personas could have helped me make these decisions more effectively and with less uncertainty.</p>
</div>
<div id="div2">
<p>One of the most significant challenges I faced was with CSS, particularly getting the footer and other elements to display correctly.
  Initially, the footer would overlap with content on smaller screens, causing usability issues. After reviewing feedback and troubleshooting with
  browser developer tools, I applied CSS techniques like flexbox to fix the problem. I also added a hover effect to some images, scaling them up when
  hovered. This process taught me the importance of testing designs across different devices and screen sizes, as small issues in responsiveness can
  have a big impact on user experience.</p>

<p>The feedback I received from peers and my instructor was helpful as well. One suggestion was to improve the site's accessibility by ensuring text
  and background colors had sufficient contrast. I addressed this by using online contrast checkers and adjusting my color palette.
  Another piece of feedback was to simplify navigation further by reducing the number of clicks needed to reach key content. While I initially ignored
  this suggestion because I liked the layered structure, I eventually agreed and restructured the navigation to prioritize ease of use,
  adding a side panel navigation to one of the pages, rather than have all of them in the top navigation header.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the semester as a whole, I’m proud of the progress I’ve made in both technical skills and problem-solving.
  While there were moments of frustration, these experiences have made me a more confident and adaptable web designer.
  If I could give advice to someone starting this class. it would be to embrace challenges as learning opportunities and to seek feedback
  often as it is an invaluable part of the design process.</p>

<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement"><h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3></a>
<p>Progressive enhancement is a web development approach that ensures all users can access core content and functionality, regardless of their device or browser.
  It starts with a basic version of a website and adds advanced features for users with more modern technology.
  This makes websites more inclusive, reliable, and user-friendly, while reducing the risk of features breaking on older or less capable devices.</p>

<p>In programming, progressive enhancement helps build systems that are robust and scalable.
  By focusing on core functionality first, developers ensure a strong foundation before adding extra features.
  This approach simplifies debugging and supports gradual improvements, making it easier to adapt to changing user needs or technologies.</p>
