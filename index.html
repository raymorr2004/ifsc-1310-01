  <p>CSS is a tool used in website building that helps create and manage the look and design of a website, like its colors, fonts, and layout.
    It works by setting up rules that apply styles to different parts of a webpage without changing the actual content.
    This makes it easier for developers to tweak the appearance and ensure that everything looks consistent across the website.</p>

  <p>Using CSS not only makes websites look good but also makes them work well on different devices, like phones and tablets.
    It helps websites load faster, makes them more accessible to people with disabilities, and allows for fun animations and interactive elements.
    CSS is key for web developers to make attractive and user-friendly websites.</p>
