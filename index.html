    <div>
  <p>Web accessibility means designing websites in a way that makes sure that all people, including those with disabilities, can navigate and interact with the web effectively.
    Examples of this include screen readers, keyboard navigation, and color contrast for people who are visually, physically, or otherwise impaired.
    Accessibility is not just about accommodating a minority; it ensures equal access and usability for everyone, creating an inclusive web environment.</p>

  <p>Building accessible websites is important because the internet has become an essential resource in everyday life.
    Making sure that no one is excluded from accessing information or services online gives individuals equal opportunities to use these resources.
    Additionally, accessibility improvements often lead to better overall user experience, including for users without disabilities, by fostering good design principles like ease of navigation and readability.</p>

<p>Creating the final project website for my web design class was a journey full of learning and overcoming challenges. One of the most intriguing aspects was addressing conflicting feedback from my sister
  and father regarding the site's functionality and aesthetics. My sister liked the colors, pictures/articles, and interactive elements, while my dad liked the paragraph middle format but thought the
  images and articles were a little too big and distracted from the center of the page. Balancing these perspectives led to me compromising between text
  and decoration, making the articles line the sides of the pages but not be too big. I ultimately chose a middle ground by incorporating a clean, somewhat
  symmetrical design with matching decoration and easy navigation.</p>

<p>One technical issue I encountered was positioning the footer and other elements using CSS. Despite following best practices, the footer would sometimes overlap
  with content or display inconsistently on different devices. Debugging this problem required experimenting with various positioning techniques, including using flexbox and grid layouts.
  I learned to rely on developer tools in browsers to inspect and adjust elements in real-time. This process highlighted the importance of responsive design and
  testing layouts on multiple screen sizes to ensure consistency and functionality. This took the most time, toggling between screen sizes and using different css elements to make it right no matter the screen size.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the project, I am proud of the growth in my web design skills, especially in dealing with real-world challenges like incorporating feedback and resolving technical glitches.
  This experience reinforced the value of flexibility and adaptability, both in design and coding. While the project had its hurdles,
  it ultimately provided me with a deeper understanding of user-centered design and responsive web development. Moving forward, I aim to approach similar projects with even more confidence and creativity.</p>
